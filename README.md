# bring-os - The *true* Batarong OS &nbsp; [![bluebuild build badge](https://github.com/valerie-tar-gz/bring-os/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/valerie-tar-gz/bring-os/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is an image built on top of Bazzite using Bluebuild, with fun/silly changes. This OS *could* be used as a daily driver, however it's not really intended for such usage.

**This project has NO affiliation with Bringus Studios, Bazzite, or any other property.**

## Installation

Currently to install bring-os you need to rebase from Bazzite KDE. Currently, bring-os only offers AMD/Intel drivers. Nvidia drivers may come at some point.
